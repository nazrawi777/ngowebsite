This endowment was explicitly dedicated to the welfare, training, and advancement of the blind and physically disabled, providing not just a physical space but a symbolic foundation for dignity through work."

These included the Bako School for the Blind, the Wolayta Sodo Education Home, and the Debre Dewa Production Center."
